# Color Consolidator

> _A *Angular + Firebase* application that helps one to consolidate colors on a styleguide used by several projects and maintained by many_

Note that the application is *far* from even started. I've only laid the foundations in which to build upon. Right now it's only a Angular/Firebase application that fetches and updates records from/to an existing open-source Firebase.

The initial code is based on the “Wire up a Backend” example on [AngularJS'][1] file.

This README will be updated as the application evolves.
